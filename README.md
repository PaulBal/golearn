# Golearn

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People from all around the world should have access to the same resources aseverybody  else. Your  location  should  not  determine  whether  you  have  access  toquality education.  This is one of the problems this platform is seeking to solve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golearn is a web application designed to create a welcoming environment forstudents and tutors.  Both parties get value from this platform:  tutors by teachingto an interested audience, and for students by having a convenient way of accessingquality  education. The  platform  is  built  around  the  a  idea  of  lectures  where  alimited number of students can join.The  tutors  can  create  public  video  lecture  rooms,  where  students  interestedabout  the  topic  of  the  lecture  can  join.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  students  can  ask  specific  questions, thus making the learning process more fun and effective.
The application has a 3-Tier Architecture - Presentation Tier, Application Tier,and Data Tier.  For the presentation layer we are using CSS, HTML and Javascript(Angular framework).  In the application layer we are defining the business logicusing Javascript (NodeJS), as for the data tier, we are using NoSQL (MongoDB).
